# Udacity-Data-Scientist-Project-1

Writing a data science blog project.

Libraries uses:
Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, pycountry_convert, CurrencyRates and datetime

Motivation:
For this project, my main theme was to see what the differences are for a variety of different variables per continent for professional developers. 

Q1. How does the continent you live in, your gender and you formal education level effect your salary as a professional developer?

Q2. What is the pay progression for a professional developer and how does this differ per continent?

Q3. How do you pronounce GIF? Does this differ per continent?

Files:
In this repo, I have my python notebook file which shows my code for cleaning, analysing data and producing the visuals necessary for my blog. I also have a zip file of the data source called survey_results_public

DSP1.ipynb - notebook containing the data analysis
survey_results_public.csv.zip - StackOverflows 2017 annual developer survey.

The results of my findings were than generally Europe, North America and Oceania follow similar trends, as do Africa, South America and Asia.
