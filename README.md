# Udacity-Data-Scientist-Project-1

Writing a data science blog project.

Libraries uses:
Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, pycountry_convert, CurrencyRates and datetime

For this project, my main theme was to see what the differences are for a variety of different variables per continent for professional developers. 

In this repo, I have my python notebook file which shows my code for cleaning, analysing data and producing the visuals necessary for my blog. 

The results of my findings were than generally Europe, North America and Oceania follow similar trends, as do Africa, South America and Asia.
